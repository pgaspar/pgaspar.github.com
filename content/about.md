Hi 👋 &nbsp;My name is Pedro. I'm a **full-stack developer** with a passion for code quality, healthy team dynamics and personal growth.

The technologies I'm most experienced with are **Ruby on Rails** (9+ years) and **React** (5+ years), but I have worked with a few other stacks over the years - and I'm always on the look out to learn more.

In my free time I enjoy working on [side-projects](https://github.com/pgaspar?tab=repositories&type=source), mentoring on [Exercism](https://exercism.io/profiles/pgaspar), spending time with my girlfriend, exercising, gaming, stargazing and following creators on YouTube and Twitch.
