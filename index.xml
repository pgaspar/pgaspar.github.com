      <description>Hi ðŸ‘‹ My name is Pedro. I&amp;rsquo;m a full-stack developer with a passion for code quality, healthy team dynamics and personal growth.
The technologies I&amp;rsquo;m most experienced with are Ruby on Rails (9+ years) and React (5+ years), but I have worked with a few other stacks over the years - and I&amp;rsquo;m always on the look out to learn more.
In my free time I enjoy working on side-projects, mentoring on Exercism, spending time with my girlfriend, exercising, gaming, stargazing and following creators on YouTube and Twitch.</description>
